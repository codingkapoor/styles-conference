# stylesconference
This projects aims to create a BOOTSTRAPPED version of 'StylesConference' website created by Shay Howe for the purpose of tutorial @learn.shayhowe.com http://bit.ly/1kjQk1b.

What it means is that StylesConference is now RESPONSIVE i.e., it has different layout when viewed on phone or a tablet to give optimal viewing experience.

This project nevertheless aims to illustrate how easily a website can be redesigned as responsive using Twitter Bootstrap framework.

This bootstrapped version of StylesConference has been test on four devices:
  1. 24" Dell Monitor
  2. 14" Dell LATITUDE E6430
  3.  9" Apple iPad
  4.  5" Mi4

You can download the source code of actual 'StylesConference' website at learn.shayhowe.com http://bit.ly/1RZB34i.

Enjoy Bootstrapping!
